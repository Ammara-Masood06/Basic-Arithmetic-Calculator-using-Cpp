**Core Functionality**
The program performs the four basic arithmetic operations: **Addition**, **Subtraction**, **Multiplication**, and **Division**. Users are prompted to enter two numbers and an operator to compute the result.

**Key C++ Concepts Demonstrated**
This simple application is a powerful demonstration of several core programming skills essential for any beginner:

**Control Flow Logic:** The code effectively utilizes the switch statement (or nested if/else logic) to interpret the user-selected operator and successfully route the program to the correct function.

**Input Validation:** It includes robust error handling logic, specifically preventing division by zero and ensuring the program gracefully manages exceptions. This showcases attention to detail and defensive programming.

**Code Readability:** The entire program is fully and clearly commented to explain the purpose of variables, control structures, and the basic arithmetic logic. This ensures the code is easily understood by other beginners or recruiters.
